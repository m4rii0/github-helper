Improve your productivity by using GitHub Helper.

## Features
### Branch name composition

It will generate a branch name based on the next pattern:
```
<issue-type>/GH-<issue-number>-<issue-title>
```
The issue type will be obtained from the issue labels with the prefix `kind/`, i.e. `kind/feature`, `kind/documentation`.
Right now there is an exception for the `kind/bug` label, which will be replaced for `bugfix`.

## Installation

- You need to install Tampermonkey (https://tampermonkey.net/).
- Then you can install the script by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m4rii0/github-helper/stable/src/helper.user.js).

## How to use it
